It is more gas-efficient because it avoids an external call by reading directly from storage.\n\nC). It provides more detailed, custom error messages upon reversion compared to the other variants.\n\nD). It is required because `AccountManager` does not store the address of a separate `Operator` contract.\n\n\nCorrect: B). It is more gas-efficient because it avoids an external call by reading directly from storage.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that this variant is more gas-efficient. Since `AccountManager` inherits from `Operator`, it has `OperatorStorage` directly within its own storage layout. Accessing this storage directly (`sload`) is significantly cheaper than making an external `call` to a separate contract. The other variants are designed for contracts that do not inherit from `Operator` and must interact with it via an interface. The `gteRouter` bypass is available in another variant as well, so that is not the unique reason for this choice.",

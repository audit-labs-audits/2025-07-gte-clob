To allow the `CLOBManager` to directly settle all trades, centralizing settlement logic in the factory contract.\n\nB). To reduce the gas cost of order placement by offloading all token transfers to the `AccountManager` after a match occurs.\n\nC). To isolate trade execution logic within each market from the central fund custody and settlement logic, which enhances modularity and security.\n\nD). To ensure that only the `GTERouter` can initiate settlements, preventing direct user interaction with the `AccountManager`.\n\n\nCorrect: C). To isolate trade execution logic within each market from the central fund custody and settlement logic, which enhances modularity and security.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that this separation isolates trade execution from fund management. The `CLOB` contract is responsible for matching orders, but it does not hold user funds. When a trade is matched, the `CLOB` instructs the `AccountManager`—the system's central vault—to perform the settlement. This design enhances security by centralizing asset custody and modularity by keeping each market's logic self-contained.",
